Original code by Jeff Key 2004-2007.  I've had this little tool forever to aid in web development.  One annoyance was that it didn't remember the user settings.
The other day I realized that the tool was written in .NET.  So I decompiled it and added the features to remember the "Stay On Top" and "Vertical" options.
